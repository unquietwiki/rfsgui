--- Premise & History

In May 2003, I was looking for a program to handle ReiserFS
partitions in Windows XP: I had installed Mandrake 9.1 &
wanted to be able to access files saved on that part of the
hard drive while using XP, since my XP partition was NTFS
& could not be written to in Linux safely. Gerson Kurz had
published "rfstool," a GPL command-line ReiserFS utility that
could read/copy directories & files. I lost my job fixing
computers earlier in the month, and wanted to develop more
of my nascent programming skills: I had yet to make a
serious project in Visual C++, despite years of interest.
I gathered together all the reference material I could,
searched the Internet for advice, and spent most of a week
coming up with versions 0.1 & 0.8 of this program: I figured
to go ahead & call my second release 0.8, since it still has
a bug or two, but is more or less what I wanted to create.

A month after 0.8 (May 2003), I went back over to clean up
my codebases, and figured out the two main tweaks for 0.9:
you could properly access the root folder now, and you could
enable & disable recursion for directory copies. 1.0 finishes
this work with partition-changing support: you can use the
information in the "Partition Dump" to switch between different
ReiserFS filesystems.

1.1 sets all copied files to read/write access & adds a program
icon.

1.2 tries to make use of the new "symlink" support in rfstool 0.14.

1.3 is compiled with SP6 of Visual C++ 6.0, and implements a
vertically-resized listbox.

1.4 provides for comboxbox selection of available partitions,
and for the saving of files to default filenames in a given
directory. Also reverted back to VC++ SP5.

2.0 is an attempt to remove unnecessary code & to become 64-bit
compatable. Depending on the build environment, a 32-bit or 64-bit
EXE is generated.

2.2 is a bug cleanup version that removes the date/time display
error from the 64-bit build, and fixes the partition MB count in
the "Partition Info" function.

--- Installation

"rfsgui" is based on "rfstool," but does NOT require it.
This release contains an EXE, a DLL, and a source folder.
The contents of this release may be put in any folder you
(the user) may desire. If you don't need the source folder,
it may be deleted. The program "may" work on older versions
of Windows, but it is designed to work under Windows 2000,
XP, 2003, etc. You should probably have local "Administrator"
rights in 2000, XP, etc.

--- Use

1. The interface is designed to be rather intutive: I should
   not need to explain how to use it. Just remember that if
   you're using any "dump" reports, or copying a file, to
   have a proper filename in the "target" box. It should warn
   you if this is not the case. :)

2. In this program, you can...

   a. Click on a filename & view its properties.
   b. Double-click on a directory name & access that directory.
   c. Manually-specify path names to list or copy.
      If none is specified, it will use the original filename. 
   d. Copy files & directories recursively.
   e. Get a copy of the partition tree.
      Saves as "dumptree.txt" if no target filename is given.
   f. Get a list of partitions on the local hard drive.
      Saves as "dumpinfo.txt" if no target filename is given.
   g. Select available partitions (logical drives) from a list.

3. In this program, you cannot...

   a. Write to any ReiserFS partition: not designed for it.
   b. Select multiple files to work on: recursive copying
      of a directory handles this task.

--- Limitations

1. RFSGUI can handle up to 32767 file entries per directory or
   subdirectory: this is arbitrary, because < 1% of any
   (sub)directory in existence has this may files in it, and the
   Win9x limitation for a listbox is 32767 entries.

2. Path & file name combinations may not exceeed 512
   characters in length. This is calculated by having a path
   name of 256 characters + a filename of 256 characters.

3. The total amount of accessable partitions is 8 drives *
   99 partitions, or 792 logical drives.

4. I do not have Windows Vista beta at this time, but I have
   gotten a report that the last version's 64-bit build (2.0/2.1)
   didn't work on it. I fixed the bug I knew was in that build, but
   I am not sure if that caused the failure or not. The 32-bit build
   worked fine on that system according to the user.

--- Tested on....

Windows XP x64 on an NTFS partition; two test ReiserFS partitions.

--- Original "rfstool"

1. rfstool can be found at http://p-nand-q.com/e/reiserfs.html
2. I've included the version 0.14 sourcetree modified for my use,
and I've commented where I've made modifications to handle bugs
I've found, or things I put in to support my program.

--- Build statistics

Both 32-bit & 64-bit builds are compiled with the version 14
Microsoft C++ compiler that comes with the 2003 SP1 SDK available
@ http://www.microsoft.com. Both builds are set with
"Maximize Speed" & "Optimize for Windows" flags.

--- License

The original RFSTOOL uses the GNU "GPL," and so does this
program, as it is a "derived work." It is free to distribute
with source code, and any code derived from it must be
accompanied by this code. Details are in COPYING.TXT.
